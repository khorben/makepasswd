Makepasswd generates (pseudo-)random passwords of a desired length.
It is able to generate its crypted equivalent.

This program needs OpenSSL to build (with development headers and libraries).
Just run "make install" and it should build and install to /usr/local.

To install to alternate locations, override the default as follows:

  $ make PREFIX=/path/to/your/prefix install

The DESTDIR variable is also supported for package maintainers.

It was tested with both the clang and GCC compilers, as well as with BSD and GNU
make. Please note however that the program now uses crypt(3), which is often
available from the libc directly. It tries to find it and link with the libcrypt
library by default; if this fails, try:

  $ make LDFLAGS= install
